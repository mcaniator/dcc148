4	ROCKY BED.
5	YOU ARE IN OPEN FOREST, WITH A DEEP VALLEY TO ONE SIDE.
6	YOU ARE IN OPEN FOREST NEAR BOTH A VALLEY AND A ROAD.
7	AT YOUR FEET ALL THE WATER OF THE STREAM SPLASHES INTO A 2-INCH SLIT
7	IN THE ROCK.  DOWNSTREAM THE STREAMBED IS BARE ROCK.
8	YOU ARE IN A 20-FOOT DEPRESSION FLOORED WITH BARE DIRT.  SET INTO THE
8	DIRT IS A STRONG STEEL GRATE MOUNTED IN CONCRETE.  A DRY STREAMBED
8	LEADS INTO THE DEPRESSION.
9	YOU ARE IN A SMALL CHAMBER BENEATH A 3X3 STEEL GRATE TO THE SURFACE.
9	A LOW CRAWL OVER COBBLES LEADS INWARD TO THE WEST.
10	YOU ARE CRAWLING OVER COBBLES IN A LOW PASSAGE.  THERE IS A DIM LIGHT
10	AT THE EAST END OF THE PASSAGE.
11	YOU ARE IN A DEBRIS ROOM FILLED WITH STUFF WASHED IN FROM THE SURFACE.
11	A LOW WIDE PASSAGE WITH COBBLES BECOMES PLUGGED WITH MUD AND DEBRIS
11	HERE, BUT AN AWKWARD CANYON LEADS UPWARD AND WEST.  A NOTE ON THE WALL
11	SAYS "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".
12	YOU ARE IN AN AWKWARD SLOPING EAST/WEST CANYON.
13	YOU ARE IN A SPLENDID CHAMBER THIRTY FEET HIGH.  THE WALLS ARE FROZEN
13	RIVERS OF ORANGE STONE.  AN AWKWARD CANYON AND A GOOD PASSAGE EXIT
13	FROM EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE CHAMBER.
14	AT YOUR FEET IS A SMALL PIT BREATHING TRACES OF WHITE MIST.  AN EAST
14	PASSAGE ENDS HERE EXCEPT FOR A SMALL CRACK LEADING ON.
15	YOU ARE AT ONE END OF A VAST HALL STRETCHING FORWARD OUT OF SIGHT TO
15	THE WEST.  THERE ARE OPENINGS TO EITHER SIDE.  NEARBY, A WIDE STONE
15	STAIRCASE LEADS DOWNWARD.  THE HALL IS FILLED WITH WISPS OF WHITE MIST
15	SWAYING TO AND FRO ALMOST AS IF ALIVE.	A COLD WIND BLOWS UP THE
15	STAIRCASE.  THERE IS A PASSAGE AT THE TOP OF A DOME BEHIND YOU.
16	THE CRACK IS FAR TOO SMALL FOR YOU TO FOLLOW.
17	YOU ARE ON THE EAST BANK OF A FISSURE SLICING CLEAR ACROSS THE HALL.
17	THE MIST IS QUITE THICK HERE, AND THE FISSURE IS TOO WIDE TO JUMP.
18	THIS IS A LOW ROOM WITH A CRUDE NOTE ON THE WALL.  THE NOTE SAYS,
18	"YOU WON'T GET IT UP THE STEPS".
19	YOU ARE IN THE HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING, WITH PASSAGES OFF IN ALL
19	DIRECTIONS.

34	YOU ARE IN A JUMBLE OF ROCK, WITH CRACKS EVERYWHERE.
35	YOU'RE AT A LOW WINDOW OVERLOOKING A HUGE PIT, WHICH EXTENDS UP OUT OF
35	SIGHT.	A FLOOR IS INDISTINCTLY VISIBLE OVER 50 FEET BELOW.  TRACES OF
35	WHITE MIST COVER THE FLOOR OF THE PIT, BECOMING THICKER TO THE RIGHT.
35	MARKS IN THE DUST AROUND THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT
35	SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE RECENTLY.  DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PIT FROM YOU AND
35	25 FEET AWAY THERE IS A SIMILAR WINDOW LOOKING INTO A LIGHTED ROOM.  A
35	SHADOWY FIGURE CAN BE SEEN THERE PEERING BACK AT YOU.
36	YOU ARE IN A DIRTY BROKEN PASSAGE.  TO THE EAST IS A CRAWL.  TO THE
36	WEST IS A LARGE PASSAGE.  ABOVE YOU IS A HOLE TO ANOTHER PASSAGE.

66	GO WEST, EAST, NE, AND NW.  PART OF THE ROOM IS OCCUPIED BY A LARGE
66	BEDROCK BLOCK.
67	YOU ARE AT THE EAST END OF THE TWOPIT ROOM.  THE FLOOR HERE IS
67	LITTERED WITH THIN ROCK SLABS, WHICH MAKE IT EASY TO DESCEND THE PITS.
67	THERE IS A PATH HERE BYPASSING THE PITS TO CONNECT PASSAGES FROM EAST
67	AND WEST.  THERE ARE HOLES ALL OVER, BUT THE ONLY BIG ONE IS ON THE
67	WALL DIRECTLY OVER THE WEST PIT WHERE YOU CAN'T GET TO IT.
68	YOU ARE IN A LARGE LOW CIRCULAR CHAMBER WHOSE FLOOR IS AN IMMENSE SLAB
68	FALLEN FROM THE CEILING (SLAB ROOM).  EAST AND WEST THERE ONCE WERE
68	LARGE PASSAGES, BUT THEY ARE NOW FILLED WITH BOULDERS.	LOW SMALL
68	PASSAGES GO NORTH AND SOUTH, AND THE SOUTH ONE QUICKLY BENDS WEST

90	YOU HAVE CLIMBED UP THE PLANT AND OUT OF THE PIT.
91	YOU ARE AT THE TOP OF A STEEP INCLINE ABOVE A LARGE ROOM.  YOU COULD
91	CLIMB DOWN HERE, BUT YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CLIMB UP.  THERE IS A
91	PASSAGE LEADING BACK TO THE NORTH.
92	YOU ARE IN THE GIANT ROOM.  THE CEILING HERE IS TOO HIGH UP FOR YOUR
92	LAMP TO SHOW IT.  CAVERNOUS PASSAGES LEAD EAST, NORTH, AND SOUTH.  ON
92	THE WEST WALL IS SCRAWLED THE INSCRIPTION, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [SIC].
93	THE PASSAGE HERE IS BLOCKED BY A RECENT CAVE-IN.
94	YOU ARE AT ONE END OF AN IMMENSE NORTH/SOUTH PASSAGE.
95	YOU ARE IN A MAGNIFICENT CAVERN WITH A RUSHING STREAM, WHICH CASCADES
95	OVER A SPARKLING WATERFALL INTO A ROARING WHIRLPOOL WHICH DISAPPEARS
95	THROUGH A HOLE IN THE FLOOR.  PASSAGES EXIT TO THE SOUTH AND WEST.
96	YOU ARE IN THE SOFT ROOM.  THE WALLS ARE COVERED WITH HEAVY CURTAINS,
96	THE FLOOR WITH A THICK PILE CARPET.  MOSS COVERS THE CEILING.

98	FAR BELOW, THROUGH A HEAVY WHITE MIST, STRANGE SPLASHING NOISES CAN BE
98	HEARD.	THE MIST RISES UP THROUGH A FISSURE IN THE CEILING.  THE PATH
98	EXITS TO THE SOUTH AND WEST.
99	YOU ARE IN AN ALCOVE.  A SMALL NW PATH SEEMS TO WIDEN AFTER A SHORT
99	DISTANCE.  AN EXTREMELY TIGHT TUNNEL LEADS EAST.  IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY
99	TIGHT SQUEEZE.	AN EERIE LIGHT CAN BE SEEN AT THE OTHER END.
100	YOU'RE IN A SMALL CHAMBER LIT BY AN EERIE GREEN LIGHT.	AN EXTREMELY
100	NARROW TUNNEL EXITS TO THE WEST.  A DARK CORRIDOR LEADS NE.
101	YOU'RE IN THE DARK-ROOM.  A CORRIDOR LEADING SOUTH IS THE ONLY EXIT.
102	YOU ARE IN AN ARCHED HALL.  A CORAL PASSAGE ONCE CONTINUED UP AND EAST
102	FROM HERE, BUT IS NOW BLOCKED BY DEBRIS.  THE AIR SMELLS OF SEA WATER.
103	YOU'RE IN A LARGE ROOM CARVED OUT OF SEDIMENTARY ROCK.	THE FLOOR AND
103	WALLS ARE LITTERED WITH BITS OF SHELLS IMBEDDED IN THE STONE.  A
103	SHALLOW PASSAGE PROCEEDS DOWNWARD, AND A SOMEWHAT STEEPER ONE LEADS

105	YOU ARE IN A CUL-DE-SAC ABOUT EIGHT FEET ACROSS.
106	YOU ARE IN AN ANTEROOM LEADING TO A LARGE PASSAGE TO THE EAST.	SMALL
106	PASSAGES GO WEST AND UP.  THE REMNANTS OF RECENT DIGGING ARE EVIDENT.
106	A SIGN IN MIDAIR HERE SAYS "CAVE UNDER CONSTRUCTION BEYOND THIS POINT.
106	PROCEED AT OWN RISK.  [WITT CONSTRUCTION COMPANY]"
107	YOU ARE IN A MAZE OF TWISTY LITTLE PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
108	YOU ARE AT WITT'S END.	PASSAGES LEAD OFF IN *ALL* DIRECTIONS.
109	YOU ARE IN A NORTH/SOUTH CANYON ABOUT 25 FEET ACROSS.  THE FLOOR IS
109	COVERED BY WHITE MIST SEEPING IN FROM THE NORTH.  THE WALLS EXTEND
109	UPWARD FOR WELL OVER 100 FEET.	SUSPENDED FROM SOME UNSEEN POINT FAR
109	ABOVE YOU, AN ENORMOUS TWO-SIDED MIRROR IS HANGING PARALLEL TO AND
109	MIDWAY BETWEEN THE CANYON WALLS.  (THE MIRROR IS OBVIOUSLY PROVIDED
109	FOR THE USE OF THE DWARVES, WHO AS YOU KNOW, ARE EXTREMELY VAIN.)  A
109	SMALL WINDOW CAN BE SEEN IN EITHER WALL, SOME FIFTY FEET UP.
110	YOU'RE AT A LOW WINDOW OVERLOOKING A HUGE PIT, WHICH EXTENDS UP OUT OF
110	SIGHT.	A FLOOR IS INDISTINCTLY VISIBLE OVER 50 FEET BELOW.  TRACES OF
110	WHITE MIST COVER THE FLOOR OF THE PIT, BECOMING THICKER TO THE LEFT.
110	MARKS IN THE DUST AROUND THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT
110	SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE RECENTLY.  DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PIT FROM YOU AND
110	25 FEET AWAY THERE IS A SIMILAR WINDOW LOOKING INTO A LIGHTED ROOM.  A
110	SHADOWY FIGURE CAN BE SEEN THERE PEERING BACK AT YOU.
111	A LARGE STALACTITE EXTENDS FROM THE ROOF AND ALMOST REACHES THE FLOOR
111	BELOW.	YOU COULD CLIMB DOWN IT, AND JUMP FROM IT TO THE FLOOR, BUT
111	HAVING DONE SO YOU WOULD BE UNABLE TO REACH IT TO CLIMB BACK UP.
112	YOU ARE IN A LITTLE MAZE OF TWISTING PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
113	YOU ARE AT THE EDGE OF A LARGE UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR.  AN OPAQUE CLOUD
113	OF WHITE MIST FILLS THE ROOM AND RISES RAPIDLY UPWARD.	THE LAKE IS
113	FED BY A STREAM, WHICH TUMBLES OUT OF A HOLE IN THE WALL ABOUT 10 FEET
113	OVERHEAD AND SPLASHES NOISILY INTO THE WATER SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE
113	MIST.  THE ONLY PASSAGE GOES BACK TOWARD THE SOUTH.
114	DEAD END
115	YOU ARE AT THE NORTHEAST END OF AN IMMENSE ROOM, EVEN LARGER THAN THE
115	GIANT ROOM.  IT APPEARS TO BE A REPOSITORY FOR THE "ADVENTURE"
115	PROGRAM.  MASSIVE TORCHES FAR OVERHEAD BATHE THE ROOM WITH SMOKY
115	YELLOW LIGHT.  SCATTERED ABOUT YOU CAN BE SEEN A PILE OF BOTTLES (ALL
115	OF THEM EMPTY), A NURSERY OF YOUNG BEANSTALKS MURMURING QUIETLY, A BED
115	OF OYSTERS, A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY STARS ON THEIR ENDS, AND
115	A COLLECTION OF BRASS LANTERNS.  OFF TO ONE SIDE A GREAT MANY DWARVES
115	ARE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR, SNORING LOUDLY.  A SIGN NEARBY READS: "DO
115	NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!"  AN IMMENSE MIRROR IS HANGING AGAINST ONE
115	WALL, AND STRETCHES TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM, WHERE VARIOUS OTHER
115	SUNDRY OBJECTS CAN BE GLIMPSED DIMLY IN THE DISTANCE.
116	YOU ARE AT THE SOUTHWEST END OF THE REPOSITORY.  TO ONE SIDE IS A PIT
116	FULL OF FIERCE GREEN SNAKES.  ON THE OTHER SIDE IS A ROW OF SMALL
116	WICKER CAGES, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A LITTLE SULKING BIRD.  IN ONE
116	CORNER IS A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY MARKS ON THEIR ENDS.  A
116	LARGE NUMBER OF VELVET PILLOWS ARE SCATTERED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR.  A
116	VAST MIRROR STRETCHES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST.  AT YOUR FEET IS A LARGE
116	STEEL GRATE, NEXT TO WHICH IS A SIGN WHICH READS, "TREASURE VAULT.
116	KEYS IN MAIN OFFICE."
117	YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF A LARGE, DEEP CHASM.  A HEAVY WHITE MIST RISING
117	UP FROM BELOW OBSCURES ALL VIEW OF THE FAR SIDE.  A SW PATH LEADS AWAY
117	FROM THE CHASM INTO A WINDING CORRIDOR.
118	YOU ARE IN A LONG WINDING CORRIDOR SLOPING OUT OF SIGHT IN BOTH
118	DIRECTIONS.
119	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
120	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
121	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
122	YOU ARE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE CHASM.  A NE PATH LEADS AWAY FROM THE
122	CHASM ON THIS SIDE.
123	YOU'RE IN A LONG EAST/WEST CORRIDOR.  A FAINT RUMBLING NOISE CAN BE
123	HEARD IN THE DISTANCE.
124	THE PATH FORKS HERE.  THE LEFT FORK LEADS NORTHEAST.  A DULL RUMBLING
124	SEEMS TO GET LOUDER IN THAT DIRECTION.	THE RIGHT FORK LEADS SOUTHEAST
124	DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE.  THE MAIN CORRIDOR ENTERS FROM THE WEST.
125	THE WALLS ARE QUITE WARM HERE.	FROM THE NORTH CAN BE HEARD A STEADY
125	ROAR, SO LOUD THAT THE ENTIRE CAVE SEEMS TO BE TREMBLING.  ANOTHER
125	PASSAGE LEADS SOUTH, AND A LOW CRAWL GOES EAST.
126	YOU ARE ON THE EDGE OF A BREATH-TAKING VIEW.  FAR BELOW YOU IS AN
126	ACTIVE VOLCANO, FROM WHICH GREAT GOUTS OF MOLTEN LAVA COME SURGING
126	OUT, CASCADING BACK DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS.  THE GLOWING ROCK FILLS THE
126	FARTHEST REACHES OF THE CAVERN WITH A BLOOD-RED GLARE, GIVING EVERY-
126	THING AN EERIE, MACABRE APPEARANCE.  THE AIR IS FILLED WITH FLICKERING
126	SPARKS OF ASH AND A HEAVY SMELL OF BRIMSTONE.  THE WALLS ARE HOT TO
126	THE TOUCH, AND THE THUNDERING OF THE VOLCANO DROWNS OUT ALL OTHER
126	SOUNDS.  EMBEDDED IN THE JAGGED ROOF FAR OVERHEAD ARE MYRIAD TWISTED
126	FORMATIONS COMPOSED OF PURE WHITE ALABASTER, WHICH SCATTER THE MURKY
126	LIGHT INTO SINISTER APPARITIONS UPON THE WALLS.  TO ONE SIDE IS A DEEP
126	GORGE, FILLED WITH A BIZARRE CHAOS OF TORTURED ROCK WHICH SEEMS TO
126	HAVE BEEN CRAFTED BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF.  AN IMMENSE RIVER OF FIRE
126	CRASHES OUT FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE VOLCANO, BURNS ITS WAY THROUGH THE
126	GORGE, AND PLUMMETS INTO A BOTTOMLESS PIT FAR OFF TO YOUR LEFT.  TO
126	THE RIGHT, AN IMMENSE GEYSER OF BLISTERING STEAM ERUPTS CONTINUOUSLY
126	FROM A BARREN ISLAND IN THE CENTER OF A SULFUROUS LAKE, WHICH BUBBLES
126	OMINOUSLY.  THE FAR RIGHT WALL IS AFLAME WITH AN INCANDESCENCE OF ITS
126	OWN, WHICH LENDS AN ADDITIONAL INFERNAL SPLENDOR TO THE ALREADY
126	HELLISH SCENE.	A DARK, FOREBODING PASSAGE EXITS TO THE SOUTH.
127	YOU ARE IN A SMALL CHAMBER FILLED WITH LARGE BOULDERS.	THE WALLS ARE
127	VERY WARM, CAUSING THE AIR IN THE ROOM TO BE ALMOST STIFLING FROM THE
127	HEAT.  THE ONLY EXIT IS A CRAWL HEADING WEST, THROUGH WHICH IS COMING
127	A LOW RUMBLING.
128	YOU ARE WALKING ALONG A GENTLY SLOPING NORTH/SOUTH PASSAGE LINED WITH
128	ODDLY SHAPED LIMESTONE FORMATIONS.
129	YOU ARE STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LARGE, BARREN ROOM.  A SIGN
129	POSTED ABOVE THE ENTRANCE READS:  "CAUTION!  BEAR IN ROOM!"
130	YOU ARE INSIDE A BARREN ROOM.  THE CENTER OF THE ROOM IS COMPLETELY
130	EMPTY EXCEPT FOR SOME DUST.  MARKS IN THE DUST LEAD AWAY TOWARD THE
130	FAR END OF THE ROOM.  THE ONLY EXIT IS THE WAY YOU CAME IN.
131	YOU ARE IN A MAZE OF TWISTING LITTLE PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
132	YOU ARE IN A LITTLE MAZE OF TWISTY PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
